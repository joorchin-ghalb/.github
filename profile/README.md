## Ghalb1403 - Heart Health Image Gallery

Reducing the occurrence and complications of heart disease has been one of the most important goals of health systems around the world in recent years. Understanding the crucial role of self-care in managing chronic and non-communicable diseases, we decided to create a project to raise awareness in our community.

Our project not only reminds people about the importance of self-care in preventing heart disease but also shows that heart health can be achieved by following these recommendations. By following these guidelines, individuals can maintain a healthy heart and reduce the risk of serious heart problems.

We hope to contribute to the health and well-being of Iranian society through this initiative.
